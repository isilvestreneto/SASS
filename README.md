# SASS: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

SASS is just CSS with superpowers. :)

In this repo I'm trying to learn how the extension SASS can improve my programming skills. With this tool I can also boost my curriculum as a Frontend Developer.

My thanks to Rocketseat and Mayk Brito for teaching me in this course.

What I learned here
1. Imports (@import)
2. Partials
3. Encadeamento
4. Variables ($varname)
5. Scopes
6. Mixins (@mixin/@include) || statement grouping
7. Conditionals (@if/@else if/@else)
8. Loops (@for/@each)
9. Functions (lighten())
10. Heritage (@extends)
11. Referencing (&:hover)
